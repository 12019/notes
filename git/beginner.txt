Initialize a Git repository

		git init

Checking the status

		git status

Adding changes

		git add octocat.txt

checking for changes

		git status

Commiting

		git commit -m "Add cute octocat story"

Adding all changes

		git add '*.txt'

Commining all changes

		git commit -m 'Add all the octocat files'

History

		git log

Remote Repositories

	git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/gry_git.git

Pushing Remotely
	The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that 
	next time we can simply run 'git push'

		git push -u origin master

Pulling Remotely
	Check for changes on the repository and pull down any new changes 

		git pull origin master

Differences
	Take a look of different from the last commit
	THe most recent commit is refered to using the HEAD pointer

		git diff HEAD

Staged Differences
	Another great use for diff is looking at changes within files that have
	already been staged. Remember, staged files are files we have told git
	that are ready to be commited.

	Let's use 'git add' to stage 'octofamily/octodog.txt', which just added to
	the family

		git add octofamily/octodog.txt

Staged Difference (cont'd)

		git diff --staged


Resetting the Stage
	So now that octodog is part of the family, octocat is all depressed.
	Since we love octocat more than octodog, we'll turn his frown acound 
	by removing octodog.txt

	unstage files by using the 'git reset' command.

		git reset octofamily/octodog.txt

Undo
	'git reset' unstaged octodog.txt, but it's still there; just not staged anymore.

	files can be changed back to how they were at the last commit by using
	 'git checkout -- <target>'

		git checkout -- octocat.txt

Branching Out
	When developers are working on a feather or bug they'll often create
	a copy (aka. branch) of their code they can make separate commits to.
	THen when they're done they can merge this branch back into their
	main 'master' branch.

	let's create a branch called 'clean_up'

		git branch clean_up

Switching Branches
	if type 'git branch', will see two local branches: a main branch named master and 
	a new branch named 'clean_up'

	Switch branches using 'git checkout <branch>'

		git checkout clean_up

Removing All the Things
	using 'git rm' will not only remove the actual files from disk, but will also stage
	the removal of the files.

		git rm '*.txt'

Commiting Branch changes

		git commit -m "Remove all the cats"

Switching Back to master

		git checkout master

Preparing to Merge

		git merge clean_up

Keeping Things Clean
	use 'git branch -d <branch name>' to delete a branch

		git branch -d clean_up

The Final Push
		git push

Delete remote branch
	git push origin --delete <branchName>
