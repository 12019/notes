	ssh -t <host> "bash --rcfile PATH_TO_RCFILE"
	ssh -t <host> "bash --rcfile PATH_TO_RCFILE -i"

	ssh -t 
		Force pseudo-tty allocation.  This can be used to execute arbitrary
		screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful,
		e.g. when imple‐menting menu services.  Multiple -t options force
		tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.

	bash -i
		If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive


	Plink (part of PuTTY)
	plink root@MachineB -m local_script.sh

	Unix-based 
	ssh root@MachineB 'bash -s' < local_script.sh

	ssh -s   
		May be used to request invocation of a subsystem on the remote
		system.  Subsys‐tems are a feature of the SSH2 protocol which
		facilitate the use of SSH as a secure transport for other
		applications (eg. sftp(1)).  The subsystem is speci‐fied as
		the remote command.
