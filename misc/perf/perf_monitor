	r	the amount of threads in the run queue.  These are runnable threads, but the CPU is not available to execute them.
	b	this is the number of processes blocked and waiting on IO requests to finish.
	In	This is the number of interrupts being processed.
	Cs	This is the number of context switches currently happening on the system.
	Us	This is the percentage of user CPU utilization.
	Sys	This is the percentage of kernel & interrupts utilization.
	Wa	This is the percentage of idle processor time due to the fact that ALL runnable threads are blocked wiating on IO.
	Id	This is the percentage of time that the CPU is completely idle.

	swpd	The amount of virtual memory in KB currently in use. As free memory reaches low thresholds, more data is paged to the swap device.
	Free	The amount of physical RAM in kilobytes currently available to running applications.
	Buff	the amount of physical memory in kilogytes in the buffer cache as a result of read() & write() operation.
	cache	The amount of physical memory in kilobytes mapped into process address space.
	so	The amount of data in kilobytes written to the swap disk.
	si	The amount of data in kilobytes written from the swap disk back into RAM.
	bo	The amount of disk blocks paged out from the RAM to the filesystem or swap device.
	bi	The amount of disk blocks paged into RAM from the filesystem or swap device.
