A core file has no sections, relocations or other extraneous information
in the file that may be required for loading an executable or library; it
simply consists of a series of program headers describing LOAD segments.
These segments are raw data dumps, created by the kernel, of the current
memory allocations.

The other component of the core dump is the NOTE sections which contain
data necessary for debugging but not necessarily captured in straight 
snapshot of the memory allocations. The eu-readelf program used in the 
second part of the figure provides a more complete view of the data by 
decoding it.

The PRSTATUS note gives a range of interesting information about the
process as it was running; for example we can see from cursig that the
program received a signal 11, or segmentation fault, as we would expect.
Along with process number information, it also includes a dump of all 
the current registers.  Given the register values, the debugger can 
reconstruct the stack state and hence provide a backtrace; combined
with the symbol and debugging information from the original binary the 
debugger can show exactly how you reached the current point of execution.
