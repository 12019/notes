x86-64 is a 64-bit extention of x86, that almost entirely removes 
segmentation in favor of the flat memory model used by almost all
operating systems for the 386 or newer processors.  In long mode,
all segment offsets are ignored, except for the FS and GS segments.
When used with 4 Kib pages, the page table tree has 4 levels, 
instead of three.  The virtual addresses are divided up  as follows:
16 bits unused, 9 bits each for 4 tree level (total: 36 bits), and
12 lowest bits unmodified.  With 2 Mib pages there are only three
levels to the page table for a total of 27 bits used in paging and
21 bits of offset.  Some newer CPUs also support a 1 GiB page with
two levels of paging and 30 bits of offset.  CPUID can be used to 
determine if 1 GiB pages are supported.  In all three cases, the
16 highest bits are required to be equal to 48th bit, or in the 
other words, the low 48 bits are sign extended to the higher bits.
This is done to allow a future expansion of the addressable range,
without compromising backwards compatibility.
