netlink - communication between kernel and userspace (PF_NETLINK)

synopsis
	#include <asm/types.h>
	#include <sys/socket.h>
	#include <linux/netlink.h>

	netlink_socket = socket(PF_NETLINK, socket_type, netlink_family);

Description
	Netlink is used to transfer information between kernel and userspace processes.
	It consists of a standard sockets-based interface for userface processes and an
	internal kernel API for kernel modules.  The internal kernel interface is not
	documented in this manual page.  There is also an obsolete netlink interface
	via netlink character devices; this interface is not documented here and is
	only provided for backwards compatibility.
	Netlink is a datagram-oriented service.  Both SOCK_RAW and SOCK_DGRAM are 
	vaild values for socket_type.  However, the netlink protocol does not 
	distinguish between datagram and raw sockets.
	netlink_family selects the kernel module or netlink group to communicate 
	with.
