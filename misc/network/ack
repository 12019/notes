TCP Seq/ACK numbers
	length of 32 bits
	Random sequence number at connection open
	each data byte is counted
	Seq/Ack numbers point to the next data to be sent/received
	The SYN and FIN packets consume one sequence number each
	This forces an ACK for these and allows destination to wait for pending data
	The max sequence number is 4,294,967,295
	At a speed of 1Gb/s (128MB/s), it would take 32 seconds to send 4,294,967,295 Bytes
	At 10Gb/s it would take 3.2 seconds.
	in reality, 1Gb line expect 920-940Mb/s (115-120MB/s)  10Gb means * 10

SYN/FIN Seq Numbers
	Host 1 app tells TCP to connect to Host 2
	Host 1 TCP Sends SYN pakcet	Seq = 10, Ack = 0
	Host 2 TCP Sends SYN-ACK	Seq = 20, Ack = 11
	...

TCP Flags
	FIN (0x01): This is part of a close sequence
	SYN (0x02): This is part of an open sequence
	RST (0x04): Reset the connection - immediate close
	PSH (0x08): Push this and all previous data to the applicaton
	ACK (0x10): The Acknowledgement field has meaning
	URG (0x20): The Urgent Pointer must be used
